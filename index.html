               I have asthma, because of my asthma, I am not able to play a lot of sports. I prefer doing things that don't need rapid movement such as coloring, online games,etc.
               <br> I like hanging out with my friends, I like playing fetch with my dog. I love playing on my laptop and Xbox.
               <br> In the evenings, I visit my elderly neighbor who also has a dog. Unfortunately, there are not kids my age close to me.
               <br> I sometimes play with my brother but most of the time it ends up in a fight, my younger brother has a lot of friends his age. I consider myself smart, I always get good grades and
               <br> I usually get my homework turned in on time.
