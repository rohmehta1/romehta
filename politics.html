            My views on Politics
        </h1>
        <p id="first">
            My dream job is to be a politician, I want to be in the U.S Congress. If I would get a chance to be elected to Congress, I’d be in the Democratic Party. 
           The President, Joe Biden, and the Vice President, Kamala Harris, are in the Democratic Party. The US Congress is divided into two parts, The House and The Senate. 
            I would run for senator, senators represent one of the 50 states and house members represent districts. It’s harder to be elected Senator. Most Presidents in America have either been a Senator or a House member.
            The Democratic party is one of the two major parties in America.”The Democratic Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, along with its main historic rival, the Republican Party. 
            It was founded around 1828 by supporters of Andrew Jackson, making it the world's oldest active political party”. The Democratic Party, members are known as “Democrats”, is known as a liberal party. 
            Some of the things they support is legal access to abortions, gun background checks and stricter gun control regulations,same-gender marriage, oppose torture,increasing federal and state minimum wages,making college more affordable and improving privacy laws. 
            The opposing party is the Republican Party, they are more conservative and use Christian beliefs to make laws, the Democratic party believes in the separation of state and church, religion shouldn’t be in politics. 
           My favorite President is Barack Obama. He ended the war in Iraq, he made the Affordable Care Act, making it healthcare more affordable, he signed the Healthy and Hunger-Free kids act, it provided healthier and cheaper food options in public schools.
