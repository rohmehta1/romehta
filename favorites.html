               Swimming is my favorite sport, I have been swimming since 2015. I can swim in deep water. 
               <br>I can also dive, but I am a bit nervous to do that. Swimming is good for people with asthma.Swimming is an individual or team racing sport that requires the use of one's entire body to move through water. 
               <br>The sport takes place in pools or open water (e.g., in a sea or lake). Competitive swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports.

               Soccer is my second favorite sport. I don't play on a team, I enjoy playing casually with my friends or family.
               <br> I always watch the World Cup, it is the only time I actually watch soccer. I don't have a favorite team in the World Cup.
               <br> I just watch for fun. I support the United States team, but they're not very good in soccer.

               Badminton is my third favorite sport. In 4th grade, I used to go the Cricket and Badminton after-school club.
               <br> I love to play badminton in the summer, it is a fun sport. It's not too intense like soccer or basketball.
               <br> In the United States, badminton is considered as a "backyard sport" meaning that people won't be playing 
               <br> competitively, they will be playing casually in their backyard.
